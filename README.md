# C-Discount-TF :_computer vision and artificial intelligence with TensorFlow_

**Goal**

The goal of this competition is to predict the category of a product based on its image(s). Note that a product can have one or several images associated. For every product _id in the test set, you should predict the correct category_id.

**Metric**

This competition is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of products you get correct).

**Submission File**

For each _id in the test set, you must predict a category_id. The file should contain a header and have the following format:


**Train**

we are using TensorFlow for: **image classifier using convolutional neural network**

**Predict**

reusing the generated model to predict the categories of all unclassified products
